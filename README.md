# Space-Explorers-Tournament
Commemorating my university's second computer science class competition, Space Explorers Tournament. I chose to study computer science after this class.
This is the archive for CSCI1933 in 2022 Spring semester, but I cannot post past courses source code to public repo due to class policy.

A game screenshot of final match. 

Team id is LLM, with Linglong Meng and Yuhan Zhou.
