# Space-Explorers-Tournament
Commemorating my university's second computer science class competition, the Space Explorers Tournament, I chose to study computer science after this class. This is the archive for CSCI1933 in the 2022 Spring semester, but I cannot post past courses' source code to public repos due to class policy.
Here is a game screenshot of the final match.
The team id is LLM; members are Linglong Meng and Yuhan Zhou.
